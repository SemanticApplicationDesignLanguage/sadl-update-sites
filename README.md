for the SADL IDE.  Each subdirectory in this repository, when accessed
via GitHub's raw content interface, looks like a valid Eclipse P2
plugin update site to Eclipse.

Copy the following URL to install the latest release of the SADL IDE
in Eclipse:

If you are a SADL developer or user who wants to test the SADL
development codebase between SADL releases, copy this URL instead:

Software..." dialog,
