This repository contains two update sites (sadl-develop, sadl-release)
for the SADL IDE.  Each subdirectory in this repository, when accessed
via GitHub's raw content interface, looks like a valid Eclipse P2
plugin update site to Eclipse.

Copy the following URL to install the latest release of the SADL IDE
in Eclipse:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SemanticApplicationDesignLanguage/sadl-update-sites/main/sadl-release>.

If you are a SADL developer or user who wants to test the SADL
development codebase between SADL releases, copy this URL instead:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SemanticApplicationDesignLanguage/sadl-update-sites/main/sadl-develop>.

To install the SADL IDE in Eclipse with Eclipse's "Install New
Software..." dialog,

- Open `Help -> Install New Software...`
- Click the `Add...` button
- Paste one of the URLs above in the `Location:` field
- Click the `Add` button
- Select `SADL Feature` or click the `Select All` button
